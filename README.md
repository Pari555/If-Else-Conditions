## If/Elif/Else Conditional Statements
Used for desision-making operations with conditions

Conditional statements always start with an 
`if` header
`elif` is optional, but we can use as many as we want
`else` is optional, but only 1 for every `if`

### Condition:
An expression that evaluates to produce a a result which is a Boolean value (AKA. Boolean expression)

### Indentation:
Python relies on indentation to define scope in the code

### Formula:
if (Condition):
> Body Statement

elif (Condition):
> Body Statement

else: 
> Body Statement

*Ex.*
```
a = 2
if (a == 0):
    print("hi")
else:
    print("bye")
```
> bye
